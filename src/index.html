                  <p>We partnered with a countywide public health initiative working to improve population-level health outcomes. The effort brought together academic researchers, nurse practitioners, and public health leaders with deep but highly technical expertise.</p>
                  <p>Our team conducted more than 50 structured SME interviews, synthesized complex research and practice knowledge, and organized a shared knowledge base that could be used consistently across audiences. From that foundation, we designed a series of seven targeted publications, delivered as accessible PDFs paired with original, audience-aware web design.</p>

                  <p>We conducted video interviews with families and providers across the county and developed a series of short, informative videos and facilitated discussion guides designed to support reflection and learning among ECE providers.</p>

                  <p>In each case, we supported immediate decision-making and operational needs while setting the organization up to hire and onboard a permanent leader, including role definition, transition planning, and onboarding support.</p>
                  <p>In other engagements, we have insourced with client teams to provide expert eLearning strategy, design, and development while supporting the growth and administration of the organization's eLearning catalog.</p>
